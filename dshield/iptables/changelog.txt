#	- New Checkpoint FW1-41 parser, to deal with more recent FW-1 log formats
#	  Also fix for framework.pl so that it doesn't attempt to load the whole
#	  log file into memory.  Now it only loads the line that it is processing.

#	- Consolodated Cisco PIX and Cisco ACL scripts into Cisco.  Updated
#	  parsing logic.
#	- Added belated support for 'last message repeated NN times'
#	- Introduced $reason_skipped variable so that parsers can give a reason
#	  why a line is skipped.  This makes getting a client working easier if
#	  the parser reports why it is failing to parse lines.
#	March 2, 2002
#	- New 'tpfw' parser that supports the Tiny Firewall when used in
#	  remote syslogging mode.   You can now capture the output of
#	  multiple Windows machines that use Tiny on a *NIX syslog.
#	  More information is in tpfw.pl.
#	  Thanks to Tim Rushing for this.  
#	January 25, 2002
#	- The hardwired filter in the iptables parser was too restrictive
