# Source IPs you would like to exclude. Good options
# are hosts which you frequently use to scan your 
# own network.
# 
# Specify as either individual IPs (24.61.22.3)
# Or as a range (127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255)
# Or in 127.0.0.0/8 format
#

# Common local (hopefully) junk we don't want to bother with.  (We can't
# trace it anyway.)
