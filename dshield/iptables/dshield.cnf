#  Sample Dshield log parser configuration file

# Name of the log file. This should be the syslog as this
# client processes 'syslog' reports.  Unless your firewall logs go to 
# a different file....

log=%%fwlog%%

# Regular expression that must match in each log line that is processed
# Needed if your log contains all kinds of different things, not just
# packet filter log lines.
# If not defined, then it will use a default that *may* work for you.
# (The default is hardwired in the parser subroutine at the end of the script.)
# If defined, then it is typically used in the parser like
#        return 0 unless ( $line =~ /$line_filter/ )
# where '$line' contains the log line we are looking at.
# 'return 0' means that this log line won't be processed if the match fails.
#
# See http://www.dshield.org/regex.html for information on regular expressions.
#
# ipchains users might use
#
# line_filter=input DENY
#
# (input DENY is the default for the ipchains parser, however, so you really
# don't need to defne it, if input DENY is correct for your log.) 

#
# regex to *exclude* log lines for whatever reason.

# What program (and options) to use for sending mail
# (When 'whereto=MAIL')

sendmail=/usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t
wget=/usr/bin/wget
# What to do with the output.  If defined as 'MAIL' then send the converted
# log to the addresses defined above.  (i.e. normal DShield operation.)
# But, if defined as a file, then will write the converted log, including
# mail headers, to a file.  You would use this if sending as mail isn't what
# you want to do.  The assumptuon would be that you'd "wrap" this script in
# another script that would do something else with the converted file.
# Possibly FTPing or SCPing it to a different machine that has a mail server.
# Or for testing and debugging, so that you don't have to fool with mail until
# you have it working right.

# These optional files contain ranges that are used to exclude 
# log lines, so you can filter out log lines that you don't want
# to submit to DShield.

target_port_exclude=/etc/dshield-target-port-exclude.lst

# Replace the first byte of the target IP with '10.'
# Note that if you set this to 'Y' then DShield won't send FightBack
# abuse reports on your behalf, even if you have enabled FightBack in your
# user profile.  (Because ISPs require a valid target IP before they will
# investigate.)

# This file is used to keep track of the time stamp of the last valid log
# line you submitted.
# If logs are not rotated so that only new lines are submitted to DShield
# Hint.  Delete this file after you are done configuring and testing.
# Or between each run while you are configuring and testing.
#
# This is really the time stamp of the last log line processed in
# yyyymmddhhmmss format, so you can manually edit this if you need to
# reset where processing will start.

linecnt=/tmp/dshield.cnt

# Setting these to "Y" makes the client spit out a lot of stuff
# to standard output, some of which may be helpful.
# If these are set to "N", then the client will only print serious
# errors.

verbose=N

# There are 3 different types of 'rotation':
#  N - No rotation                           Don't do anything to the log file
#
#  Y - rename the log file to 'logfile.bak'  The contents of any existing
#                                            'logfile.bak' will be lost!
#                                            You probably don't want to do this.
#                                            unless you are really short on
#                                            disk space.
#
#  A - append the log file to 'logfile.bak'  This is much safer.
#
#  (If you let your system do log rotation, then this client will
#   miss log lines right after the rotation.  But if we do the rotation....)
#
#  Note this has nothing to do with the system's log rotation.  The client
#  will not look in, for instance, /var/log/messages.1, etc.  The rotate 
#  variable only controls if this script will rotate the log file.

rotate=N

# 'tz' is the time zone (relative to GMT). 
# by default, it is retrieved automatically and does not
# have to be set here, unless you are processing logs 
# that were collected in a differen time zone.
# 
# tz=-04:00

# tmp file.  Is created during processing and erased after we are done.
# The default is /tmp/dshield.PID.tmp  (PID is the Process ID)

# tmpfile=/tmp/dshield.tmp

# (For Portsentry, too.)
# If you are using the tpfw parser (Tiny Personal Firewall), then your log lines
# will not contain a target ip address.  However, they will list the machine name
# that sent the syslog entry to your logging server.  For example, entries sent 
# from a machine named samantha would begin something like 
# "Feb 28 09:06:43 samantha Rule "
#
# In order to get your logs into an acceptable format, you need to supply a 
# dshield.cnf entry that will tell the script what ip address to use for any 
# entries coming from a particular machine.  Note:  You can have a single script 
# process entries from multiple machines if there are entries from more than
# one machine in the logs.  Also note that this means that this 
# script is unusable if you do not have a fixed ip address.  If the samantha machine
# in the example above had a static ip of 10.134.23.197, then your dshield.cnf entry 
# would be

#samantha=10.134.23.197
